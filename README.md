## About PLG

Profession Leveling Guide (PLG) is an in-game, load on demand guide to help you level your professions faster.  The addon loads with the WoW professions tradeskills window.  PLG will suggest a recipe that uses the fewest or cheapest materials that will give you the most skillups.  It will tell you what to make, how many to make, if you need to keep them for the next recipe, where to get the recipe, and when to see your trainer.  No complicated setup, no options, just load and go.

* Always remember this is just a guide.  If there is an orange recipe that works better and you have the materials, use it.  And then let me know..
* If any Recipes/Patterns are incorrect, or another pattern works better for a particular level, please send me the information and I'll update the addon.
* If PLG is not working with your TradeSkill addon, let me know and I'll try to support it.
